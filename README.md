## How To Use
1. Download the [current releases](https://github.com/ChrisgammaDE/SBV-Cleaner/releases) and extract it
2. Export current subtitles as `.sbv` from amara and copy it into the folder
3. Double click on the `sbvcleaner.exe`
4. Enter the filename of the `.sbv` file
5. Import the `.fixed.txt` file back to amara and continue working


## Limitations
- This tool strips all timings
- It's CLI only



## Legal Note
I try my best to make it work, but:
- You are using this at your own risk
- I can't fix your computer if you do stupid stuff
- This is a sunday-evening project, so please don't use it in production
