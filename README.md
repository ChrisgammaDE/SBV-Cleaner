## How To Use
1. Export current subtitles as .sbv from amara
2. Create a folder to contain everything we're doing in a moment. (e.g. make a folder on the desktop)
3. Copy the `.sbv` file into the folder
4. Download the executeble from the [current releases](https://github.com/ChrisgammaDE/SBV-Cleaner/releases) and copy it into the folder
5. Double click on the `sbvcleaner.exe`
6. Enter the filename of the `.sbv` file
7. Import the `.fixed.txt` file back to amara and continue working




## Limitations
- This tool strips all timings
- It's CLI only



## Legal Note
I try my best to make it work, but:
- You are using this at your own risk
- I can't fix your computer if you do stupid stuff
- This is a sunday-evening project, so please don't use it in production
